Question 1
# The code was written in python language.
# This code separates a sentence to its individual words that make up the sentence.
# It prompts the user to input a sentence, then it gives the words that constitutes the sentence as the output.


Question 2
# The code prompts the user to input the file name from which the text is.
# Make sure that the file is in the same directory as the tokenizer.l file 
# Some of the rules that will are implementeed in the .l file are as follows:
1. Match words (letters and apostrophes)  with optional numbers and print them on separate lines.
2. Match numbers and print them on separate lines
3. Match special characters and print them on separate lines
4. Giving the word count of the document

# To run the code, use the terminal and change directory to the folder containing the tokenizer.l file.

# Then use the command flex tokenizer.l.

# Then input the following command gcc lex.yy.c, which will produce the the a.exe file
